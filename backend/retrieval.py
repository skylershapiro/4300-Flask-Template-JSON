#This script handle's the information retrieval component of this project. 
#User queries will be sent from the frontend ---> the backend.
#This script will find a set of relevant documents in our dataset using this query

    #a "parse_query.py" that smoothly passes Frontend output into this retrieval system in the backend

#SIMPLIFIED FOR TA MEETING 3/19
